# üöÄ Open Source Guides

![Build Status](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/workflows/GitHub%20Actions%20CI/badge.svg)

[üîó Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) are a collection of resources designed for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to **run** and **contribute** to an open-source project.

## ü•∑ Background

Open Source Guides were created and are curated by **GitHub**, with valuable input from outside community reviewers. However, these guides are not limited to GitHub products. One key reason for starting this project was the recognition that there weren‚Äôt enough resources for people creating open-source projects.

Our goal was to aggregate **community best practices** ‚Äî not just what GitHub or any other organization thinks is best. Therefore, we included examples and quotations from others to better illustrate our points.
